## Summary

Load large data into the node, including accounts, transactions, and realm objects.

We simulate three types of applications with a large active user base of 1 million over a year of usage. We start by loading 100 GB of data for each application.

### Usage.

Keygen, sign, and broadcast are three asynchronous processes.

Ex.

To generate 1000 key signer, sign 100 messages and broadcast 100 messages.

make sure we deploy or preload the forum.gno to gno.land/r/x/benchmark/load

```
make build

./build/loadrunner keygen 1000  

// append entries in the newly created ./genesis_balances.txt to gno.land/genesis/genesis_balances.txt

./build/loadrunner sign 100  
./build/loadrunner broadcast 100

```

To inspect un-broadcasted transactions.

```
./build/loadrunner list <address>
```

To list summary

```
./build/loadrunner list
```

### forum: large data post.  we start from 100G / 1M user = 100K bytes per user average a year. the target is 1TB  total.

 1M user x 100 post in 100 board in 365 days = 2739 messages per board per day.
 100K bytes per user a year / 100 post = 1kb per post
 1KB x 100 Post x 1M Users = 100GB  
 1KB size x 1000 board x 100 Post Message x 1 Tx  x 1000 User = 100G

1KB message

### swaps: high volume of transactions, less item to trade
//  350 byte per token swap transaciton. 150K transaction per day. 52.5MB in size per day  
//  5 swaps x 365 day x  60 MB = 100G  

### nft platform: large inventory, less transactions
